## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Introduction

My name is John, I am an undergrad at the University of Tennessee studying GIST.

### Skills and Expertise

I am still very new to any form of coding, but I am trying my best so please don't bully me.

### Interests and Hobbies

Some interests of mine outside of coding that nobody cares about are video games and music. My favorite video game has been The Last of Us since I first played it in 2014, but recenetly finishing Disco Elysium has made it difficult for me to choose a single game as my favorite. My current favorite artist is probably Frank Ocean, but this changes almost every other week.
